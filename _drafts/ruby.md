Ruby is a general-purpose scripting language. It is used for writing all kinds of programs, but it's most well-known for its association with Rails, a web development framework built with Ruby. Rails was used to build popular web applications like Twitter, Groupon, GitHub, and Basecamp.

Ruby was also used to build Jekyll. You won't need to know how to read and write Ruby code to get started with Jekyll, but you will need to set up a Ruby programming environment on your computer. There are a few pieces that you'll need:

- Ruby
- RVM
- RubyGems
