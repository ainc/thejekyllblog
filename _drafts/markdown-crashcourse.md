If you're reading this post, you may have heard of 'HTML'. If you're familiar with what those 4 letters mean, then you'll know that HTML is a Markup Language. There are other markup languages, including LaTeX, ... (other markup languages). Then there's this thing called Markdown. It's kind of the opposite of a Markup Language. When you write a document using Markdown formatting, it can be parsed by a Markdown Processor, and turned into an HTML document.

Quick recap:

Markdown --> HTML --> Looks nice in your Browser

There are a few reasons to use Markdown instead of HTML.

- You are a Human. While HTML is a great way for Humans to speak to computers (in particular, Web Browsers) in their own quirky language, Markdown is more Human-friendly.

- You're writing on a device without a full physical keyboard. Markdown has become a popular way to input formatted text in envirionments where there's not a full-fledged keyboard with `Shift` and `Alt` keys, chords, and easy access to brackets and braces.

- You want to save time. Creating and re-creating HTML tags takes time. If you're a fan of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, then putting little `<p></p>` tags around all your paragraphs is a bit laborious.

One of the challenges with Markdown is that there's no `spec` or Specification. With HTML, there's [this specification][html-spec]. If you life in the United States, here's [a spec for your power outlets][power-spec].

Check out the [Markdown description][markdown-fireball] for more info on what Markdown can do. Then, compare it with [GitHub-flavored Markdown][markdown-github].

Enough talk, let's do some things with Markdown! I like the [80/20 principle][pareto], so here's the 80%:

Paragraphs: just start writing
Lists: 
Headings: 
Emphasis:
Links:  
Images: 

And here's the 20% (ie MOST people will never use these):
Syntax highlighting: backticks (by the '~' key, use your left pinky finger) are your friend
